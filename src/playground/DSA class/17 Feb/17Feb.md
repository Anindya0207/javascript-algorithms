Saerching
    Linear Saerch
    Binary Saerch
Sorting
    Basic: 
    
    Bubble Sorting
    Selection Sorting
    Insertion Sorting

    Advance:

    Merge sort
    Quick sort
    Heap sort

    Counting sort
    radix sort

Hashing
    Different Hashing algorithm
    Collision techniques (One index have two elements in aray. what to do? that 's collision technique)

Linked list
    Single Linked list
    double linked list
    circular linked list

Stack
Queue
    Normal queue
    Circular queue
    Priority Queue
Tree
    Binary Tree
    Binary Saerch Tree
        Traversal
        Insertion
        Deletion
    AVL Tree
        Rotation
Graph
    BFS
    DFS


Binary Search
    Array should be sorted
    We need to go to middle. and see if the search element is greater than middle, then the search element will be in right or else left part of array. 
    Recursive approach and Iterative approach - recursive approach can lead to stack overflow if there are two many calls.
