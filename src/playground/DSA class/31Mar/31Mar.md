# Whenever we need to do nay operation in cycle, we take slow pointer and fast pointer
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/


# Can we do Binary search in linked list

10 < 20 < 30 < 40 < 50 < 60
head                    tail

this.counter = 5 / 2

this.low 

this.high

this.mid

// finding mid
this.counter = findLen(start, end);
pivot = this.low;
let i = 0;
while(i < this.counter/2) {
    this.mid = pivot;
}


//changing mid

while(this.low != this.high) {

}
mid == el return
this.low = mid
this.high;

findMid(this.low, this.high)

OR we can do this with fast pointer slow pointer approach
When the fast pointer reaches end, slow pointer is my mid


# how to find and delete duplicates from a linked list

Approach1: using a map lookup
1 2 3 4 5 2 7 8 9 

map = {
1
2
3
4
5
}

Approach 2:

1 2 3 4 5 2 7 8 9 


10 20 30 40 50
