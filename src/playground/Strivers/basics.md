1. when in a loop we keep on diving the number, like while (n > 0).... n = n / x; then the time complexity is O(logx N)
2. Euclidean algorithm states that GCD(a,b) = GCD(a % b, b) where a > b
const findGCD = (num1, num2) => {
  if(num1 == 0) return num2;
  if(num1 > num2) return findGCD(num1 % num2, num2);
  return findGCD(num2 % num1, num1);
}
3. A subsequence is a sub-sequenece which should follow the order of the actual sequence. it can be either contiguous or non contiguous
[3,1,2] => [3] [1] [2] [3,1] [3,2] [1,2] [3,1,2] these are all possible subsequence. 
[3,2] is a non contigious subsequnce
[1,2,3] is not a subsequence becuase it doesn't follow the order.
This can be achieved by Power set also which is mentioned in 6May.md

4. To rotate a array by k we can simply do
arr1 = [...arr]
arr[i] = arr1[(i+k)%arr.length]
This is very powerful formula to rotate the array or to check if an array is rotated k times. 
To check if A and B are same array but after k rotation
A[i] = B[(i+k)%A.length]

5. Length of longest subarray with K sum using Prefixmap/Hashing
  var lenOfLongSubarr = (arr, k) => {
    let map = {}, maxLen = 0, sum = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      sum = sum + arr[i];
      if(map[sum] == undefined) map[sum] = i;
      if(sum == k) {
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i+1);
      }
      if(map[sum - k] != undefined) {
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i - map[sum - k]);
      }
    }
    console.log(maxLen)
  }
  
6. Dutch National Flag algo
This algorithm contains 3 pointers i.e. low, mid, and high, and 3 main rules.  The rules are the following:

arr[0….low-1] contains 0. [Extreme left part]
arr[low….mid-1] contains 1.
arr[high+1….n-1] contains 2. [Extreme right part], n = size of the array
The middle part i.e. arr[mid….high] is the unsorted segment. 

There can be three different values of mid pointer i.e. arr[mid]
If arr[mid] == 0, => swap(arr[low], arr[mid]) low++; mid++
If arr[mid] == 1 => mid++
If arr[mid] == 2 => swap(arr[mid], arr[high]); high--

7. Moores Voting Algo

Initialize 2 variables:
Count –  for tracking the count of element
Element – for which element we are counting
Traverse through the given array.
If Count is 0 then store the current element of the array as Element.
If the current element and Element are the same increase the Count by 1.
If they are different decrease the Count by 1.
After the traversal, if count > 0 the Element can be the majority element.
Step 2: We also need to verify if it is the majority element by running through the array and count the occurance > n/2

var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    let el = null, count = 0
    for(var i  = 0; i <nums.length; i++) {
        if(!count) {
            el = nums[i]; count = 1;
        } else if(nums[i] == el) {
            count++;
        } else {
            count--;
        }
    }
    return el;
}

8. Kadane's Algo

We will run a loop(say i) to iterate the given array.
Now, while iterating we will add the elements to the sum variable and consider the maximum one.
If at any point the sum becomes negative we will set the sum to 0 as we are not going to consider it as a part of our answer.

var maxSubArray = function(nums) {
    let max = -Infinity, currSum = 0;
    for(var i= 0; i <nums.length; i++) {
        currSum = currSum + nums[i];
        max = Math.max(max, currSum);
        if(currSum < 0) {
            currSum = 0;
        }
    }
    return max;
};
